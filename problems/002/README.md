## Fizz Buzz - AlgoDaily Day 2

Fizz Buzz is a classic interview question that apparently many engineering candidates can't solve! Let's cover it today.

We're given a number in the form of an integer n.

Write a function that returns the string representation of all numbers from 1 to n based on the following rules:

If it's a multiple of 3, represent it as "fizz".

If it's a multiple of 5, represent it as "buzz".

If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5, represent it as "fizzbuzz".

If it's neither, just return the number itself.

As such, fizzBuzz(15) would result in '12fizz4buzzfizz78fizzbuzz11fizz1314fizzbuzz'.
