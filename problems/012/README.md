## Detect Substring in String - AlgoDaily Day 12

How would you write a function to detect a substring in a string?

If the substring can be found in the string, return the index at which it starts. Otherwise, return -1.

```
function detectSubstring(str, subStr) {
  return -1;
}
```

Important-- do not use the native String class's built-in substring or substr method. This exercise is to understand the underlying implementation of that method.
