## Find the Intersection of Two Linked Lists - AlgoDaily Day 26

Assume you have a Linked List implementation that has the following API:

```
// prepend to start of list
#prepend(val);
```

```
// appends to end of list
#append(val);
```

```
// get an array of node values (for testing)
#toArray();
```

Can you write a method getIntersection(list1, list2) to find the intersection of two linked lists?

The return value should be a new linked list.
