## Find Missing Number in Array - AlgoDaily Day 17

We're given an array of continuous numbers that should increment sequentially by 1, which just means that we expect a sequence like:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

However, we notice that there are some missing numbers in the sequence.

```
[1, 2, 4, 5, 7]
```

Can you write a method missingNumbers that takes an array of continuous numbers and returns the missing integers?

```
missingNumbers([1, 2, 4, 5, 7]);
// [3, 6]
```
