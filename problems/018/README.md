## Sum All Primes - AlgoDaily Day 18

You're given a number n. Can you write a method sumOfAllPrimes that finds all prime numbers smaller than or equal to n, and returns a sum of them?

For example, we're given the number 15. All prime numbers smaller than 15 are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

They sum up to 41, so sumOfAllPrimes(15) would return 41.
