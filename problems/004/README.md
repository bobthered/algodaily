## Is An Anagram - AlgoDaily Day 4

Here's the definition of an anagram: a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another: such as cinema, formed from iceman.

We are given two strings like "cinema" and "iceman" as inputs. Can you write a method isAnagram(str1, str2) that will return true or false depending on whether the strings are anagrams of each other?
