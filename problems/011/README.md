## Sum Digits Until One - AlgoDaily Day 11

We're provided a positive integer num. Can you write a method to repeatedly add all of its digits until the result has only one digit?

Here's an example: if the input was 49, we'd go through the following steps:

```
// start with 49
4 + 9 = 13

// move onto 13
1 + 3 = 4
```

We would then return 4.
